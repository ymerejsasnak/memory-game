memory-game
===========

Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)





for practice with new stuff: add some nice simple jquery animations for card flipping and matching!


!also need to make it not allow new flips until 2 unmatched cards are flipped back (just set a simple flag)

!also need to disable click event after win...and add click event to body to auto reload page (or programmatically reset board if easy enough)



best to add card functions to game object itself?
also much refactoring needed to modularize code better (especially the repetition of the settimeout to wait to flip cards)
also not always clear whether i am referring to card index on board or card value itself (in variable names, etc)



underscore really necessary just for shuffle and sample functions?



!!!DONT FORGET TO REMOVE HELPER LETTERS ON FACE DOWN CARDS WHEN DONE TESTING!!!!
