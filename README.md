memory-game
===========

Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)


for practice with new stuff: add some nice simple jquery animations for card flipping and matching!


2 special cards: 1 that reshuffles remaining cards, 1 that auto-matches a random pair (make it so these are replayable or not?)

let play go until end, 'high score' being least # of turns



best to add card functions to game object itself?
also much refactoring needed to modularize code better

!also need to make it not allow new flips until 2 unmatched cards are flipped back (just set a simple flag)


underscore really necessary just for shuffle function?
couldn't I just randomly pick an element from array, then splice that element out afterward, and repeat?




!!!DONT FORGET TO REMOVE HELPER LETTERS ON FACE DOWN CARDS WHEN DONE TESTING!!!!
