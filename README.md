memory-game
===========

Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)





for practice with new stuff: add some nice simple jquery animations for card flipping and matching!


let play go until end, 'high score' being least # of turns




best to add card functions to game object itself?
also much refactoring needed to modularize code better (especially the repetition of the settimeout to wait to flip cards)
also not always clear whether i am referring to card index on board or card value itself (in variable names, etc)

!also need to make it not allow new flips until 2 unmatched cards are flipped back (just set a simple flag)


underscore really necessary just for shuffle function?
couldn't I just randomly pick an element from array, then splice that element out afterward, and repeat?



!!!DONT FORGET TO REMOVE HELPER LETTERS ON FACE DOWN CARDS WHEN DONE TESTING!!!!
