memory-game
===========

Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)





for practice with new stuff: add some nice simple jquery animations for card flipping and matching!



==refactoring==
-best to add card functions to game object itself?
-also much refactoring needed to modularize code better (especially the repetition of the settimeout to wait to flip cards)
-also not always clear whether i am referring to card index on board or card value itself (in variable names, etc)
-underscore really necessary just for shuffle and sample functions?
