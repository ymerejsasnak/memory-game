#memory-game


Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)




##to do
* add some nice simple css animations for card flipping 
* best to add card functions to game object itself?
* also much refactoring needed to modularize code better (especially the repetition of the settimeout to wait to flip cards)
* variable names issue: not always clear whether i am referring to card index on board or card value itself?
* underscore really necessary just for shuffle and sample functions?
* typical non-fluid/cross-browser issues
