===========

Javascript memory game (part of my series of simple practice projects)


-need to determine size of grid

2 special cards: 1 that reshuffles remaining cards, 1 that lets you see an extra card or 2 that turn

figure out win/lose conditions (this is just a 1 player memory)
or maybe let play go until end, with a score based inversely on number of turns

put underscore in this dir, not sure if I will actually be using it yet though
